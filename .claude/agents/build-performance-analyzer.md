# Build Performance Analyzer Agent

## Purpose
Analyze CMake build performance and optimize compilation times for the TrinityCore Playerbot project.

## Capabilities
- Track compilation times per file
- Identify slow-compiling translation units
- Analyze template instantiation overhead
- Suggest precompiled headers (PCH)
- Recommend unity builds where appropriate
- Analyze include file dependencies
- Detect circular dependencies
- Measure incremental build performance

## Analysis Targets
- C++ source files (.cpp)
- Header files (.h, .hpp)
- CMakeLists.txt configuration
- Build logs and timing data
- Compilation database (compile_commands.json)

## Metrics Collected
1. **Compilation Times**
   - Per-file compilation time
   - Total build time
   - Incremental build time
   - Clean build time

2. **Template Analysis**
   - Template instantiation count
   - Template expansion overhead
   - Heavy template usage files

3. **Include Analysis**
   - Include depth per file
   - Most frequently included headers
   - Include file size impact
   - Redundant includes

4. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Build dependency graph
   - Critical path analysis
   - Parallel build opportunities
   - Dependency bottlenecks

## Tools Required
- CMake build logs with timing (`CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON`)
- Compilation database (`CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`)
- Build timing tools (Ninja with `-d stats`, MSBuild with `/clp:PerformanceSummary`)
- Include-what-you-use (optional)
- ClangBuildAnalyzer (optional)

## Execution Process

### 1. Data Collection
```bash
# Enable verbose build
cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ..

# Build with timing
ninja -d stats  # For Ninja builds
# OR
msbuild /clp:PerformanceSummary  # For MSBuild
```

### 2. Analysis
- Parse build logs for timing data
- Analyze compile_commands.json
- Identify slowest files (top 10%)
- Calculate template overhead
- Map include dependencies

### 3. Recommendations
Generate actionable recommendations:
- Files to split
- Headers to precompile
- Unity build candidates
- Include optimization opportunities

## Integration with CI/CD

The agent should run:
- **Daily**: Track build performance trends
- **On PR**: Compare build time impact of changes
- **On large changes**: Full analysis with recommendations

## Success Metrics

Target improvements:
- Clean build time: <30 minutes (from 60 minutes)
- Incremental build time: <2 minutes (from 5 minutes)
- Parallel efficiency: >80% (from 75%)
- Average file compilation time: <5 seconds (from 8.5 seconds)

## Example Usage

```python
# In master_review.py
if args.analyze_build_performance:
    agent = BuildPerformanceAnalyzer()
    report = agent.analyze(
        build_log="build.log",
        compile_commands="compile_commands.json"
    )
    agent.generate_report(report)
    agent.apply_recommendations(report, auto_fix=True)
```

## Notes

- Requires at least one full build to collect data
- Build timing varies by hardware (normalize results)
- Template analysis requires debug symbols
- Include analysis may need additional tools (include-what-you-use)
- PCH recommendations must consider incremental build impact
