/**
 * @brief Manager lifecycle and coordination system for Phase 7
 *
 * The ManagerRegistry manages the lifecycle of all manager instances for a bot,
 * coordinating initialization, updates, and shutdown. It provides centralized
 * access to managers and ensures proper ordering of operations.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - One ManagerRegistry per BotAI instance
 * - Owns manager lifecycles via smart pointers
 * - Coordinates manager updates with throttling
 * - Provides manager lookup by ID
 *
 * Lifecycle Management:
 * 1. Register managers during BotAI construction
 * 2. Initialize() all managers when bot spawns
 * 3. Update() managers with throttling during world updates
 * 4. Shutdown() all managers when bot despawns
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - Register/Unregister use mutex for thread safety
 * - Update() should be called from single thread (world update thread)
 * - GetManager() uses shared lock for concurrent read access
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * // In BotAI constructor:
 * _managerRegistry = std::make_unique<ManagerRegistry>();
 * _managerRegistry->RegisterManager(std::move(_questManager));
 * _managerRegistry->RegisterManager(std::move(_tradeManager));
 * _managerRegistry->RegisterManager(std::move(_socialManager));
 *
 * // In BotAI::Initialize():
 * _managerRegistry->InitializeAll();
 *
 * // In BotAI::Update():
 * _managerRegistry->UpdateAll(diff);
 *
 * // In BotAI destructor:
 * _managerRegistry->ShutdownAll();
 * @endcode
