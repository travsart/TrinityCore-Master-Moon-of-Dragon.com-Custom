/**
 * @brief Base interface for all manager classes in the Playerbot system
 *
 * This interface provides the foundation for the manager architecture,
 * enabling event-driven communication between observers and managers.
 * All managers (QuestManager, TradeManager, MovementManager, etc.) should
 * implement this interface to participate in the event system.
 *
 * Phase 7.1: Observer-Manager Integration Layer
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Observers detect events (Phase 6)
 * - EventDispatcher routes events to managers (Phase 7.1)
 * - Managers implement this interface to handle events (Phase 7.1+)
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - All OnEvent() implementations MUST be thread-safe
 * - Events may be dispatched from any thread
 * - Use appropriate locking mechanisms when accessing shared state
 *
 * Performance Requirements:
 * - OnEvent() should complete in <1ms for most events
 * - Heavy processing should be deferred to Update() cycle
 * - Use event priority to control processing order

     * @brief Handle an event dispatched from an observer

     * This is the primary integration point between Phase 6 observers and Phase 7+ managers.

     * which routes it to all subscribed managers via this method.

     * Implementation Guidelines:
     * - Use switch statements on event.type for efficient dispatch
     * - Validate event data before processing

     * - Return quickly to avoid blocking the event queue
