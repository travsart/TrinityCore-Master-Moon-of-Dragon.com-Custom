 * @brief Generic event handler interface
 *
 * Template interface for type-safe event handling. Each event type
 * requires a specialized handler implementation.
 *
 * **Design Pattern:** Template Interface Pattern
 * - Type safety at compile time
 * - Zero runtime overhead (inline/devirtualization)
 * - Clean separation of concerns
 *
 * **Usage:**
 * ```cpp
 * class BotAI : public IEventHandler<LootEvent>,
 *               public IEventHandler<QuestEvent>
 * {
 *     void HandleEvent(LootEvent const& event) override { ... }
 *     void HandleEvent(QuestEvent const& event) override { ... }
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @tparam TEvent The event type this handler processes
