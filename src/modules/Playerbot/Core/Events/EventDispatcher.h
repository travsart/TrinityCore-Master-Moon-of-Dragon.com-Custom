/**
 * @brief Centralized event routing system for Phase 7
 *
 * The EventDispatcher acts as the bridge between Phase 6 observers and Phase 7+ managers.
 * It provides a thread-safe, high-performance event routing mechanism that connects
 * event detection (observers) to event handling (managers).
 *
 * Architecture:
 * 1. Observers detect events and call Dispatch()
 * 2. Events are queued in thread-safe concurrent queue
 * 3. ProcessQueue() dequeues events and routes to subscribed managers
 * 4. Managers receive events via IManagerBase::OnEvent()
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - Dispatch() is thread-safe and lock-free (moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue)
 * - Subscribe/Unsubscribe use mutex for subscription map protection
 * - ProcessQueue() should be called from single thread (world update thread)
 *
 * Performance:
 * - Lock-free event queue for minimal contention
 * - Event batching to reduce per-event overhead
 * - Priority-based event ordering
 * - <0.01ms overhead per event dispatch
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * // In BotAI initialization:
 * _eventDispatcher = std::make_unique<EventDispatcher>();
 * _eventDispatcher->Subscribe(EventType::QUEST_ACCEPTED, _questManager.get());
 * _eventDispatcher->Subscribe(EventType::TRADE_INITIATED, _tradeManager.get());
 *
 * // In Observer:
 * BotEvent evt(EventType::QUEST_ACCEPTED, botGuid, questGiverGuid);
 * _eventDispatcher->Dispatch(evt);
 *
 * // In BotAI::Update():
 * _eventDispatcher->ProcessQueue(100); // Process up to 100 events per update
 * @endcode
