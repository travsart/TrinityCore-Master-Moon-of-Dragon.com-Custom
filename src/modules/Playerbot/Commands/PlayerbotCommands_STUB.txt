COMPILATION ERRORS IN PlayerbotCommands.cpp

The chat commands need to be rewritten to match actual PlayerBot APIs:

ISSUES:
1. BotSessionMgr doesn't have Instance() - uses instance() (lowercase)
2. BotSessionMgr doesn't have GetPlayerBots(), RemoveAllBotsForPlayer(), RemoveBot(), GetTotalBotCount(), GetActiveBotCount()
3. WorldSession doesn't have GetBotAI() method
4. BotSpawner constructor is private - need to use sBotSpawner singleton
5. BotSpawner::SpawnBot() signature doesn't match
6. PlayerbotConfig access pattern is wrong - need sPlayerbotConfig

REQUIRED: Complete API research before implementing commands.

For now, using minimal stub to allow compilation.
