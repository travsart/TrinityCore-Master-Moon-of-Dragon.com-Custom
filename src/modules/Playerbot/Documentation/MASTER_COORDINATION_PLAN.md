# PlayerBot Development Master Coordination Plan
## Group-First Testing Strategy

### Executive Summary
This master plan coordinates the development of the PlayerBot module with a focus on group functionality as the primary testing requirement. The goal is to achieve testable group behaviors before implementing individual bot capabilities.

### Critical Success Metrics
- **Primary Goal**: 5000 concurrent bots with <0.1% CPU per bot and <10MB memory per bot
- **Testing Priority**: Group functionality with automatic invitation acceptance and combat coordination
- **Platform**: Windows 11, Visual Studio 2022, WoW 11.2 compatibility

## Development Phases Overview

### Phase 1: Core Group Functionality [CRITICAL - Week 1-2]
**Objective**: Establish basic group mechanics for immediate testing
- Group invitation acceptance system
- Leader following mechanics
- Target assistance and sharing
- Basic combat engagement

### Phase 2: Combat Coordination [HIGH - Week 2-3]
**Objective**: Implement synchronized group combat
- Threat management in groups
- Role-based positioning
- Interrupt coordination
- Crowd control management

### Phase 3: Advanced Group Behaviors [MEDIUM - Week 3-4]
**Objective**: Enhance group coordination
- Formation management
- Dungeon/raid behaviors
- Loot distribution
- Quest sharing

### Phase 4: Individual Bot Intelligence [LOW - Week 4-5]
**Objective**: Add individual decision-making
- Solo activities when not grouped
- Resource gathering
- Auction house interaction
- Personal quest completion

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization [CRITICAL - Week 5-6]
**Objective**: Achieve performance targets
- Memory optimization
- Thread pool implementation
- Database query optimization
- Resource monitoring

## Agent Coordination Matrix

### Primary Agents (Group Functionality)
| Agent | Role | Phase Focus | Deliverables |
|-------|------|-------------|--------------|
| wow-bot-behavior-designer | Lead for group AI | 1,2,3 | Behavior trees, group logic |
| trinity-integration-tester | Core integration | 1,2,5 | Hook validation, compatibility |
| wow-mechanics-expert | Combat systems | 1,2 | Spell mechanics, combat rules |
| cpp-architecture-optimizer | System design | 1,5 | Module architecture, performance |
| test-automation-engineer | Testing framework | All | Unit tests, integration tests |

### Supporting Agents
| Agent | Role | Phase Focus | Deliverables |
|-------|------|-------------|--------------|
| concurrency-threading-specialist | Threading | 5 | Thread pools, lock-free structures |
| windows-memory-profiler | Memory analysis | 5 | Memory optimization |
| code-quality-reviewer | Code standards | All | Review checkpoints |
| resource-monitor-limiter | Resource tracking | 5 | Performance monitoring |
| database-optimizer | Query optimization | 4,5 | Database schema, indexing |

## Communication Protocols

### Daily Sync Points
1. **Morning Status**: Agent progress review
2. **Midday Checkpoint**: Blocker resolution
3. **Evening Integration**: Code merge and testing

### Conflict Resolution
1. **Technical Conflicts**: cpp-architecture-optimizer has final say
2. **Game Mechanics**: wow-mechanics-expert has authority
3. **Performance Issues**: windows-memory-profiler leads investigation

### Integration Points
- All code must pass trinity-integration-tester validation
- Group behaviors require wow-bot-behavior-designer approval
- Performance changes need resource-monitor-limiter clearance

## Risk Management

### Critical Risks
1. **Group System Integration**: May conflict with existing TrinityCore group mechanics
   - Mitigation: Early trinity-integration-tester involvement
2. **Performance Degradation**: Group coordination overhead
   - Mitigation: Continuous profiling with windows-memory-profiler
3. **Combat Synchronization**: Network latency in group actions
   - Mitigation: Predictive behavior models from wow-bot-behavior-designer

### Contingency Plans
- If group invitations fail: Implement fallback manual grouping
- If performance targets missed: Scale back concurrent bot count
- If combat sync issues: Implement action queuing system

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Metrics
- [ ] Bots accept group invitations within 2 seconds
- [ ] Bots maintain formation within 10 yards of leader
- [ ] Bots engage same target as leader within 1 second
- [ ] Zero crashes in 1-hour group testing session

### Overall Project Success
- [ ] 5000 concurrent bots operational
- [ ] <0.1% CPU usage per bot verified
- [ ] <10MB memory per bot confirmed
- [ ] All group functions working in dungeons/raids
- [ ] Passing all automated test suites
