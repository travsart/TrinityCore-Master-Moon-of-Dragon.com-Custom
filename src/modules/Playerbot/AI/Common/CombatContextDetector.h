/**
 * @class CombatContextDetector
 * @brief Detects current combat context for utility-based action scoring
 *
 * Context detection logic:
 * - Solo:          Not in group (all solo activities)
 * - Group:         In group, open-world content (not in instance)
 * - DungeonTrash:  In 5-man instance, not fighting boss
 * - DungeonBoss:   In 5-man instance, boss encounter active
 * - RaidNormal:    In raid instance (10-40 players), normal/LFR difficulty
 * - RaidHeroic:    In raid instance, heroic/mythic difficulty
 * - PvPArena:      Battleground type = arena
 * - PvPBG:         Battleground type = battleground
 *
 * Performance: <0.1ms per detection, cached per update cycle
 * Thread Safety: Read-only, safe for concurrent access
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * CombatContext context = CombatContextDetector::DetectContext(bot);
 * ActionScoringEngine engine(BotRole::HEALER, context);
 * @endcode
