/**
 * @brief Manages automatic bot recruitment for LFG (Looking For Group) system
 *
 * This manager monitors human player queue joins and automatically populates groups
 * with appropriate bots based on role requirements. It handles:
 * - Detection of missing roles in queued groups
 * - Selection and queueing of suitable bots
 * - Automatic proposal acceptance for bots
 * - Role check confirmation for bots
 * - Tracking of bot assignments to prevent double-queueing
 *
 * Thread-safe singleton implementation using Meyer's singleton pattern.
